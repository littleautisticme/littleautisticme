Welcome to The LittleAutisticMe Blog!

This blog has been created by a short autistic guy to give my perspective on things.

Some of the content here will be about autism and some will have nothing to do with autism but it will all be from the point of view of this particular autistic person.

I do not claim to speak for any other autistic person or people.  I hate when other people (fellow autists or advocates) claim to speak for me and so I will not be so disrespectful.

I don't expect you to agree with all or even any of my opinions but I do completely expect you to reapect that they are mine and that I have the absolute right to them just as you have to yours.

If you have a legitimate reason to contact me, please use the email address listed on this site or contact me via Twitter,  Do not use any of these contact methods to try to advertise anything to me or to attempt to argue with me.  I will not engage in either of these cases.  Please also do not contact me asking for help or support - I am neither qualified nor emotionally able.  I will delete any content sent to me which I see as trauma dumping; I have my own issues to deal with.

All that said, thank you for visiting, I hope you enjoy your stay and come again soon.
