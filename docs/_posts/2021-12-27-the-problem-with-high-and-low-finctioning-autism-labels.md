title: "The Problem With High and Low Functioning Autism Labels"

Since starting my autism diagnosis journey (and I hate that word being used in this context) I have noticed a few phrases being bandied about which really bother me. Some of these phrases are used by my friends and family, most of whom don’t really know any better and some by professionals who really should know better.

The first expression was one which I heard from the GP whom I approached to request referral to a specialist. After asking me what made me think I might be autistic she gave me a big speech about “high functioning autism” and “low functioning autism”. I had heard these expressions before but never really gave them much thought. From what I’ve read, these are diagnostic terms which are no longer supposed to be used in a professional setting.

High functioning autism is a term used to describe someone who is verbal, mobile and has no visible signs of disability (I’m probably oversimplifying) whereas low functioning autism usually means nonverbal, having no independent mobility and requiring a great deal of support on a daily basis.

These terms were supposed to have been dropped in favour of levels 1 to 3 which are based on the amount of support required by an autistic person.

The reason why I take exception to the use of high and low functioning as terms is that both are negatory. Low functioning negates the validity of an autistic person, it makes them sound like less of a viable human being and I find it extremely derogatory. High functioning negates the support needs of an autistic person.

I would be described as high functioning because I’m verbal, can express myself in a predominantly coherent (and somewhat eloquent) manner and I’m independently mobile. This does not mean that my life is not exceptionally difficult. It does not mean that I do not need a high level of support, I really do!

I cannot leave home by myself or go on public transport because of the anxiety I feel in public. I need someone to remind me to do things because I have problems remembering some stuff and because I avoid doing things (pathological demand avoidance). There are far more areas in my life where I need support, some of which I get from friends and family and some I just don’t get because the system does not cater well for me as an adult who hasn’t yet finished going through the diagnosis process.

So, to describe me as high functioning; to negate the issues I face, is to me ignorant and offensive.

Thanks for reading.
