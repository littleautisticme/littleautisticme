title: "Stop Telling People What To Eat (And Drink)"
author: DJ

I would like to ask people of the internet (and in real life actually) to please stop telling people what to eat. If what you eat works for you then that’s great but I eat what I eat so that I’m eating something. I can’t change what I eat because I then avoid eating.

I’ve tried dietary changes and it leads to me starving myself. I’m seeing a lot of very judgemental posts on Twitter (and other social media sites) berating people for their diets and it’s really not helpful, in fact it’s downright toxic.

I’ve also had people tell me IRL that I should stop eating this and start eating that. Please stop doing that. Put simply, you don’t know why people eat stuff that you don’t and you don’t know the impact that trying to change might have on their health.

The same applies to criticising people's choice of drink. There are very few liquids that I can drink because of sensory issues.  If I try to drink something different then I avoid drinking and end up dehydrated.  This is the same for many autistic people.

Please stop judging people and just let them do what works for them.
