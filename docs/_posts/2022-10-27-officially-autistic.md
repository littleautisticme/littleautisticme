Today, I received my report from the NHS team who conducted my autism assessment and as expected, they have concluded that I am autistic.

I expected to feel relieved or sorted or something exceptionally positive and I do to some extent but to be honest, I feel a bit lost. What now? Should I be contacting someone? Is there something I am supposed to do?

It was over a year ago since I contacted my GP about this; a year of waiting for the assessment and a year of trying to ready myself for this day but I feel like a year wasn’t long enough. I don’t feel ready. That said, I wouldn’t want it to be any longer than that.

I understand that without a diagnosis it’s difficult for the professionals to provide support for a specific condition but I feel like in the interim period something could have been done to prepare me for this. Some type of counselling, advice on resources to study or even just a warning that feeling the way I do right now is a possibility.

I feel a bit lost right now. The practitioner who assessed me did tell me that a copy of the report would be sent to my GP so I assume he’ll be in touch and hopefully be able to direct me to some service or something which can help me to move forward.
