title: "Never Tell Me To Smile"

I’m writing this because it happened to me today. What made it worse was that the person who told me to smile is actually quite a close friend who really should have known better.

There have been many times in my life when people have told me to smile and it really gets on my nerves. There are (at least) 3 reasons for this:

1. I didn’t realise that I wasn’t smiling; I’m autistic and my face does whatever the hell it feels like doing.
2. Maybe I don’t feel like smiling because I’m feeling overwhelmed, having a meltdown or in burnout.
3. What the hell has it got to do with you whether I’m smiling or not?

Recently I’ve been going through a quite long period of burnout and so feeling quite down and absolutely exhausted. I’ve been struggling to be around people but trying to do so because otherwise I’ll feel like a shit human being who is letting people down. Because of all this and (see point 1) I can’t control my facial expressions, I probably haven’t been smiling. Telling me to smile, however, will make me feel considerably worse and will make it less likely that I will smile any time soon.

Please, for the love of whoever or whatever you worship, don’t tell people to smile. Whilst this especially applies to autistic people, you don’t know what’s going on in anyone’s mind and don’t have the right to question or criticise someone in this manner.
