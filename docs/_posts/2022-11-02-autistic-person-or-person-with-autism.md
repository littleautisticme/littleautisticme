title: "Autistic Person or Person With Autism?"
author: DJ

I’ve just been having a discussion with my sister about terminology used in association with autism.  It seems that, as with so many things in life, there is no consensus.  I suppose this is because everyone thinks differently.

Specifically, we were talking about the use of phrases “autistic community” versus “autism community” and “autistic person” versus “person with autism”.  Personally, I would be inclined to use autistic community and I refer to myself as an autistic person.  I have done this since before I was even diagnosed.  I know that not everyone would use the same expressions and that is fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinions.

I’m not sure why I feel like autistic community is more correct so I can’t explain that but I do have pretty strong feelings about autistic person.  To me the expression “autistic person” shows that whilst my condition does not define me, it does explain me.  I feel that “person with autism” seems like it diminishes autism and makes it sound like a disease.  For some reason, it sounds to me like person with syphilis.  Note that I’m not comparing autism to syphilis so don’t even think about having a go at me for that.  If you read it like that then that’s your problem and you’re probably just looking to start an argument so take your negativity elsewhere.  It sounds to me like person with autism makes autism an afterthought, like it doesn’t have much of an impact on the lives of people like me when it really does.

I have noticed that a lot of the terminologies applied to autistic people seem to be imposed by neurotypical people, usually in a professional role and this to me is very wrong.  I also feel that for me to tell another person how to refer to themselves would be wrong and that is not my intention.  I’m simply giving my views.

However you refer to yourself is entirely your choice.  Please feel free to let me know your thoughts on this.
