# Words And Expressions Which Get On My Nerves
Hack: When used instead of the word tip (e.g. lifestyle hack) this phrase triggers me so much! Everything is now referred to as a “hack” when it’s actually not. I keep seeing things online like “this new iPhone hack will make turning your iPhone on much easier” and the hack is “press the power button.” That’s not a hack, it’s an instruction. Also: “this household hack will clean stubborn dirt from your microwave” followed by “place some lemon wedges and water in a bowl, microwave for 30 minutes then wipe the inside of the microwave with a damp cloth.” Nope, not a hack that’s a cleaning tip.

Literally: I am literally so over the use of the word literally. It is used far too often and many times incorrectly. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard someone say “I literally shit myself” meaning the person was scared. My response to this is invariably “that must have been messy.” Darlings, for future reference, if you did not actually, physically shit yourself then you literally did NOT shit yourself because literally means that it actually happened.

If you’re the person who uses the words above in ways which drive me mad then please feel free to go jump up your own arse.

I will add to this list as more things piss me off. It may well end up being a very long list, there are a lot of things which aggravate me.
