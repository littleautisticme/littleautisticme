title: "A Very Autistic Christmas"

I decided that as I could have someone travel with me I would visit family for Christmas.  Travelling to Scotland from England is difficult for me at the best of times because it involves being on a train with a bunch of people whom I don't know and therefore don't trust, I have to deal with staff members at several points in the journey and there is noise and visual distractions everywhere.  Travelling at Christmas time is so much worse!  The people whom I would normally encounter are more likely to have been drinking and even those who have not been are usually much louder because of the excitement of the holiday season.

I figured that it would be worth it though because I haven't seen my mum in months.  Whilst up in my home country I thought it would be nice to visit some other family members too.  My niece, her husband and their kids to be specific.

The anxiety started on the morning of Christmas Eve (the day I was due to travel).  When I awoke, I looked at my phone to find a notification from Trainline telling me that my outbound train had been cancelled due to staff shortages.  I assume someone has been in contact with someone who tested positive for Covid and half of the staff had to isolate because of this.  I understand that this is a real issue but that doesn't help me.

I managed to get a train eventually and that part of the journey went smoothly.  I got to my mum's house and was really happy to see her.  I spent Christmas day and Boxing day at my mum's and had a really nice time.  The 27th of December was to be the undoing of all the positivity.

The 27th was the day I had arranged to visit my niece and her family.  I was excited for this as I hadn't seen them in quite a few months.

On the train to my niece's house, a man decided that he had to sit right behind me on a train which was really quite empty.  The man can sit wherever he likes; I respect his freedom.  The problem I had with him was actually that he spent the whole train ride talking on his phone and not very quietly.  I now know more about this man's life than I do my own.  I know that he had split up with his girlfriend and that he wanted to get back with her.  I know that he takes drugs because after begging her to take him back he asked her to order him some for when he went to visit her.  I know that his daughter likes dancing and that he isn't safe in the area where we were going because according to him everyone there wants to kill him.

This entire conversation made me so uncomfortable that I kept feeling the urge to 'stim'.  Now, my stimming in anxiety-inducing situations takes the form of punching myself in the leg and hitting my forehead.  I am aware of this and I try to stop myself from doing it in public which tends to make it worse.

When I arrived at my niece's house, her dog started barking.  It was a high-pitched bark which was really getting to me.  Occasionally she would calm down but when anyone moved she started right back up again.  We went upstairs to the lounge and the dog stayed in the kitchen so I hoped all would be peaceful.  I was wrong.

Whilst upstairs, one of the kids became exceptionally hyper and shouty which added to the aggravation.  My niece has a flashing Christmas light in the window which kept catching my eye and making me feel really agitated.

Whilst I was travelling back home, the train I was supposed to be on was cancelled yet again. I found this out just as the previous train was pulling out so I had to spend an hour sitting in a packed train station feeling anxious as hell.

As I sat waiting, yet another man sat right next to me talking loudly on his phone. He was drunk and once again the conversation turned to ordering drugs and buying booze. This made me feel even more anxious.

I eventually got on my train and couldn’t stop myself from punching my now constantly shaking leg. As the journey proceeded I eventually started to calm down. That lasted until I got to Preston train station where there were two small dogs barking loudly.

I decided to go outside for a cigarette where two beggars were talking quite loudly about getting mugged, the last thing I needed to hear really. By the time I arrived back in Blackpool, I was once again punching my leg and before the end of the night smacking myself in the head.

And this is why I am so desperate to get my driving licence back. If you see me begging for money on my posts then you’ll know why. I used to drive; many years ago I passed my test but never sent the certificate away. Two years passed and because of that I can’t drive. It makes life so difficult because of the anxiety of travelling on public transport. I now know that the reason for my absurd and aggravating oversight is PDA (pathological demand avoidance). Damn you stupid brain. The DVLA told me that even though they now do everything automatically, when I passed (and they have it on record that I did) the law was that you had to send the certificate manually so they can’t give me my licence back without doing everything again. It’s somewhere between fair enough and ridiculously mean but it is what it is.

Anyway, I would like to ask you, dear reader: when you’re out and about, please consider that some people are autistic and some people for other reasons suffer from anxiety. If you are around other people, please think of how your being loud might affect them. I’m not trying to tell you what to do, just asking for a bit of consideration.

Thanks for reading this and I hope you had an easier Christmas than I did.
