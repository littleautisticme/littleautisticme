title: "You Don't Look Autistic"

And you don’t look ignorant but here we are having this conversation.

Please, never tell an autistic person that they don’t look autistic. I’m sick of hearing this. Also, telling me that I don’t seem autistic isn’t helpful.

I AM autistic, whether I look, seem or sound autistic or not, I am. I even have a pretty report from 2 qualified professionals to prove it. You telling me that I don’t look, seem or sound autistic is, quite frankly, fucking offensive.

I know the difficulties I face in life, I know the daily struggles I have. Stepping out of my house, making or receiving phone calls, making and attending appointments without support, even just communicating with people in a socially-acceptable way in a face to face situation are all major problems for me. These and so many more things mean that, whilst you may not see them as I sit here typing a post on the internet, or on the right day, at the right time, in the right place, with the right support I AM AUTISTIC.

As the saying goes, not all disabilities are visible. I ask that you remember this before you next think of telling someone that they don’t meet your very prejudiced version of what an autistic person is and that you stop yourself from saying it. If you cannot stop yourself then please inform autistic people of your inability to not discriminate so that we may save ourselves the upset and disassociate ourselves from you.
