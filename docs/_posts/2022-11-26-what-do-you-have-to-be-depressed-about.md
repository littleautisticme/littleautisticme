title: "What Do You Have To Be Depressed About?"

This is a question that until recently I couldn’t answer.

I was diagnosed as suffering from depression when I was (I think) about 18 years old. There wasn’t anything particularly wrong in my life. I have a great family, I had a partner who loved me, tons of friends, a great job and to the outside world, the perfect life. So, why was I depressed?

I was first asked this question by a woman with whom I worked. She asked it and told me that I have a good life and that I was too young to be depressed (who knew depression was so discriminatory?) I think she was trying to be helpful but in reality, questions and remarks like these just make it worse. Please never discuss depression in such terms.

It turns out that depression often goes hand-in-hand with autism and surprise, I’m autistic! I didn’t find that out until very recently and suddenly it made sense. What I have to be depressed about is that on a daily basis I struggle to understand what is going on in the world. I don’t mean current affairs although those are confusing to most people, I mean nearly everything. I find people confusing, I don’t feel like I fit in anywhere, I feel tired all the time from trying to be “socially acceptable” and trying to figure out whether somebody is in a good mood or a bad one or whether they’re being serious or joking. I struggle to do things because of the overwhelming need to not do them, light, noise and everything else bugs me and constant pain doesn’t help.

There are periods of time when I feel happy (but don’t expect me to smile on command - that’s a whole post in itself), times when I feel neutral (most of the time) and times when I feel like I just can’t face the world. Nothing has to have happened for the way I feel to change, it just happens. Of course, when I’ve been overwhelmed by something, it’s more likely that I’ll go through a period of can’t cope and the annoying thing is that often happens after some really fun event. Dealing with people in general is also typically overwhelming to me but I mightn’t feel it until afterwards. Usually when there’s been any kind of negative interaction I’ll be hiding in my room for several days trying to fix my brain (as much as it can be fixed).

From this, as you will see, depression in autistic people (and many non-autistic people) doesn’t have to be because of some bad event. Sometimes it just is.

So, there’s your answer. I’m not depressed by being autistic but I believe my depression is part of being autistic (or at least a side effect of it).

If any of this resonates with you and you haven’t already done so, please seek help. Go and speak with your GP or if you’re feeling really down then contact a mental health crisis team such as The Samaritans. Sometimes even just talking with a friend or family member can be helpful. Whether you’re autistic or not, there are people out there who can help you and who want to help you.

Please note, I am not a medical professional or an expert of any kind. I am just an autistic guy trying to make sense of a later in life diagnosis and sharing my views with you.
