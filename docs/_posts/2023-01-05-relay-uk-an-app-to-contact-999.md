title: "Relay UK - An App To Contact 999"
author: DJ

Iâ€™ve just found about an app which can be used by autistic people and anyone else who finds making a voice call difficult to contact the emergency services (999) in the UK.

It is called Relay UK and you can read about it on the [National Police Autism Association](https://www.npaa.org.uk/using-an-app-to-contact-the-999-service-in-an-emergency/) website. You will also find the link to download the app in the same page.

For many, me included, this is a massive help. I struggle to convey information in a voice call, especially when under pressure and so I have already got this installed on my phone.

The Relay UK system can also be used for some other phone calls.  Check it out to find out if it can help you.
