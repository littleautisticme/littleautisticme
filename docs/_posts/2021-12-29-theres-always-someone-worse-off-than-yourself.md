title: "Stop With The There's Always Someone Worse Off Than Yourself"

I hate it when people say “there’s always someone worse off than yourself”. It may well be that it’s true but it’s completely irrelevant.

Put simply, your problems are your problems and their problems are theirs. The fact that someone else’s problems may be worse than yours does not negate how serious your problems are to you or how much of an impact they have in your life.

This is an expression I’ve been hearing my whole life and I wish people would stop saying it. It is so harmful. When people hear expressions like it, they often avoid dealing with their issues because it makes them feel like they are trivial.

I, myself have avoided dealing with issues which caused me to become severely depressed because people kept telling me how other people’s problems were worse. Please don’t allow anyone to make you feel like your problems don’t deserve consideration.
