title: "Not Commenting, Too Much Hassle"

Sometimes the internet is far too much work. There are too many cognitively biased people using it for it to be fun. I should probably be more specific and say that I’m talking mainly about social media although the same applies to blog posts with comments enabled.

I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve seen people correcting someone who had posted factually inaccurate information only to be either berated because the original poster can’t just admit that they were wrong, even when provided indisputable proof, or to be told that they need to get a life (or words to that effect).

It’s so frustrating. Just accept that you’re wrong, thank the person for educating you and move on with your life.

I’ve been the victim of such berating because I pointed out to one of my friends that a post accusing somebody of being a paedophile has been shown to be wrong and a malicious lie spread by a spurned ex-partner. I expressed concern that this exceptionally defamatory post was not only illegal but also had already destroyed a completely innocent person's life. I was told to “shut up” and met with such phrases as “better safe than sorry”.

I have also been slated for posting opinions on some things, and I hasten to add, opinions which are not on any subject that could be construed as offensive. I’m talking about such things as liking or disliking a tv show or a song. On such things, I am happy to hear the opinions of other people but not when they involve insults or vitriol. It’s as if some people just can’t accept that other people have different views than they do.

I find it completely ridiculous that people see this type of behaviour as acceptable. I am old enough to remember when the internet was actually fun. I now just find it tiring and depressing.

If you’re reading this, please stop to think before you comment. Google stuff to find out if it is accurate, examine multiple sources and accept that your opinion is not the only one in the world. Also accept that other people are just as entitled to have an opinion as you are.

Rant over.
