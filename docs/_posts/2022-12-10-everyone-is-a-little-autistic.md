Wrong! Please stop saying this. Autistic people are autistic, other people are not. It really is that simple.

Neurotypical people and non-autistic, neurodivergent people may have attributes in common with autistic people, that doesn’t mean they are “a little autistic”. Even autistic people aren’t “a little autistic”, we’re autistic, end of. We may have differing support needs to each other but we are no more or less autistic than each other.

Using such expressions minimises the issues that we, as autistic people face; often severe and debilitating issues and only makes life much more difficult for us as it causes people to take our problems less seriously than they should.

I have personally lost count of the number of neurotypical people who have said this to me and I would like to ask that it stop, now.
