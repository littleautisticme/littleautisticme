title: "Stop Telling People Not To Drive"

I see so many people telling everyone that they shouldn’t be driving a car because it’s bad for the environment and that they should cycle or use public transport.

I get the sentiment but you’re basically telling many disabled people never to leave their homes.

I cannot use public transport because people. They can be noisy and unpredictable and they cause me far too much anxiety. And even when people aren’t being like that I have the constant worry that someone will kick off. I cannot cycle because I live in a country where we have bad weather more often than not and the places I need to go are too far for me to cycle with the hips and knees that I have. It would cause me way too much pain. I do believe that protecting the environment is important but I will not give up the little freedom I have.

Before trying to make people feel guilty, try thinking about what they are going through. Not everyone is you and not everyone has the abilities that you have.
