title: "Homes Under The Hammer - The Music"

I would like to start by saying that I actually like Homes Under The Hammer.  I like the premise and format of the show.  I don't even have a problem with the various hosts of the show (except that I perhaps find Tommy Walsh to be a bit full on).

The issue that I have with Homes Under The Hammer is the choice of music.  They have this tendency to choose songs that have, at best, a tenuous link to the content.  When a song is played, it typically has a title which matches something said by the host and nothing at all to do with what is being shown on the screen or the house they are presenting.

This is really annoying and something which I think they should sort out for future episodes.  I actually feel like they would be better off using far less music in the show in general.  I find it very distracting and just plain annoying.

As an autistic person, I do have a problem with music being used in any type of video (unless it is used minimally).  I tend to find it prevents me from focusing on what is going on or being said.  I love music but only when I'm not trying to concentrate on anything else.

I am aware that this is a sign of modern life.  People seem to like a lot of noise and won't watch anything which is sedate and for those people, I'm sure this is perfect.  Not for all of us though.

When planning a show, I feel like the people should maybe consider all the potential viewers including those of us who have sensory processing issues but I am aware of the old adage: you can't please all the people all the time.  It would just be nice if they could try to find a slightly happier medium.

Anyway, I'm off to hide in a quiet corner now.
