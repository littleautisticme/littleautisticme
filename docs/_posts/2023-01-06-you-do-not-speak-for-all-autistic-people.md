title: "You Do Not Speak For All Autistic People"
author: DJ

I’ve noticed that a lot of people; autistic, advocates and even some professionals, seem to think and in some cases even state that they speak for all autistic people. Sometimes it’s intentional and sometimes not so much, for example “autistic people like …” or “autistic people believe …” Don’t do this!

Whilst it’s true that autistic people tend to have certain things in common, we are not all the same. We are individuals with differing thoughts, feelings, experiences and views of the world.

Only the other day, I saw a non-autistic person on Twitter telling an autistic people that he should refer to autistic people at "people with autism or people who have autism".  I informed this person that I refer to myself as an autistic person and another user commented similarly.  The person who tried to correct the original poster promptly appologised.  Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon occurrence.

Please don’t presume that it’s ok to speak for us. I, and only I speak for me. I love hearing other people’s views and experiences but they are not necessarily mine and I don’t appreciate people passing their opinions off as mine.

I really don’t mean for this to sound aggressive but I feel like I have to say it and can’t think of a way to say it without appearing aggravated (probably because I am).
