I would like to start by saying that I am not associated with Compass although I do know the owner.

Compass Cafe Bar is located at 24 Birley Street, Blackpool. It is open 7 days a week and, like a lot of Blackpool businesses their hours vary slightly depending on the time of year. You can find updates on their Facebook page at <https://www.facebook.com/compasscafebar>.

Compass is a lovely venue, one in which I (as an autistic adult) feel very comfortable. The staff are really nice, the food is amazing and even when the place is busy, I’ve never known it to be loud. They do play music in the background but I don’t find it to be too loud or overwhelming. The cafe and toilets have always been spotless when I’ve been there.

They have indoor and outdoor seating available so it’s the perfect place to eat and drink all year round.

Compass are famous for their all day breakfasts which can be served either on a plate or in a frying pan! I love this idea but for me, a plate is necessary.

My choices when I visit are the Gym Special (toast with scrambled egg) or an all day breakfast which I build myself because I can be quite a fussy eater at times. The chef is always working on new and interesting dishes so there’s always something different to choose.

Compass cater for everyone. If you have a particular dietary requirement just ask one of the lovely staff members.

Hope to see you there soon!
