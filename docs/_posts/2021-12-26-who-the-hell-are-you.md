Well hello there and welcome to my new blog! My name is DJ and I’ll be your tour guide. Please keep your arms and legs inside the page at all times and we are not responsible for anything ever.

So, with the silly introduction over, I’ll tell you a little about myself. You probably aren’t bothered but I’ll do it anyway.

I’m nearly 40, I live in Blackpool, England and I honestly don’t think I’m particularly interesting. I wanted to start writing about my “journey” (and I hate the use of that word in this context) on the off chance that it might help someone who has gone through or is going through the same as me.

I have not yet been officially diagnosed as autistic but am one step away from it. I have gone through all the process except the big assessment. It’s taken nearly a year so far, a lot of soul searching, self-analysis, uncomfortable discussions with countless people (friends, family, professionals, complete strangers and quite frankly anyone who listens) and some extremely difficult diagnostic questionnaires.

At such a late stage in life, it was a massive shock to come to the realisation that the reason for the unceasing difficulties and cock-ups in my life can be explained by autism. I wish I had figured this out sooner, my life could have been so much easier if I had but there we go.

My plan for this blog is to detail my experiences and to give my opinions on things that matter to me. I hope you find what I write to be interesting but to be honest it won’t make any difference to me if you don’t.

Thank you for reading this. If any of it sounds interesting to you then please check back for more content. If not then cheerio.

P.s. shameless plug of my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/geekbrigade) (please feel free ‘buy me a coffee’ if you like my content, thanks muchly)

N.B. I am not a medical professional and nothing I say is intended to be medical guidance. If you think you may be autistic and wish to pursue diagnosis then I strongly advise you to get in touch with your GP or other relevant healthcare provider.

ETA: Since writing this post, I have been formally diagnosed as autistic.
