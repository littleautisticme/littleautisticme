title: "Orion Kelly (That Autistic Guy) - YouTube"

I recently started watching videos created by Orion Kelly after the YouTube algorithm informed me of him. His channel can be found at <https://youtube.com/@orionkelly>. Orion is autistic and he makes videos explaining how autism affects him in his everyday life.

I find Orion’s videos really useful as I identify with most of what he says. I’ve even sent links to his videos to my friends and family because I actually feel that he does a better job of explaining thing than I do, even things that I feel.

Whether you’re an autistic person who is trying to make sense of your own condition or an advocate or carer looking to better understand autistic people, I’d highly recommend checking out Orion’s YouTube channel.

The only things that bug me are:
1. He has made a few videos stating that things are facts when they are actually generalisations or his opinions. This is something I feel quite strongly about because I feel it can undermine the actual points trying to be made in the videos which are often otherwise good points. 
2. He sometimes uses expressions like "all autistics" which again is generalising.  Not every autistic person has the same feelings or experiences.

I wouldn’t let these things put me off watching though.  I value how informative his channel is.
